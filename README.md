# 📨 OutreachAuto

**OutreachAuto** is an AI-powered lead generation and outreach assistant built with **Django**.  
It allows users to search by **company**, **job title**, or **keyword**, and automatically generates **personalized outreach messages** for relevant LinkedIn profiles. Each result includes a **direct profile link** and can be **downloaded as a CSV** for export or CRM integration.

## 🌟 Overview

OutreachAuto combines web search, AI-generated personalization, and a clean, intuitive interface to simplify your prospecting workflow.

**In one step, you can:**
1. Search for professionals by role or company (e.g., _"Meta Software Developer"_).
2. Automatically fetch public LinkedIn profiles via **SerpAPI**.
3. Generate **customized outreach messages** using your integrated AI function.
4. View results in a responsive UI.
5. Export everything to a CSV for downstream use in HubSpot, Salesforce, or your email sequences.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User enters a query** like `Snowflake Data Engineer`.
2. The backend constructs a **Google search** using SerpAPI:
3. The JSON results are parsed to extract LinkedIn profile links and snippets.
4. Each snippet is passed into your **LLM** (`query_llm()`) to generate a **customized outreach message**.
5. The messages and links are returned to the browser and displayed in elegant cards.
6. The user can then **download** the current batch as a CSV.
